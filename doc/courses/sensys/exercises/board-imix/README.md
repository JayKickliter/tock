The imix Platform
=================

*Note: this is a slightly modified version of the imix platform,
 used in the Tock course. The major modification is that the
 ambient light system call driver has been replaced with a capsule
 that directly samples the sensor within the kernel. The capsule 
 is correctly instantiated in the boot sequence but its functional
 code is empty, to be filled in by the person taking the course.*
